# crosslibTest-study
Contains the dataset prepared and the detailed results obtained in the study that investigates whether similarities among functions across different libraries and their associated test suites can be leveraged to reveal defects in one another.

The detailed study is available as a publication at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8730155. Consider citing the publication in case you use the dataset.

Theme-wise matches from testing and training library pairs, along with the similarity scores may be found in directories listed below:

- String and numeric manipulation

- Structural validation

- Natural language processing

- Inter-theme

Note: The excel sheets in the directories are named with convention match_\<TrainingProjectName\>_\<QueryProjectName\>.xlsx

Defects Revealed: The Defects.xlsx sheet includes description of defects revealed from the study, along with the link to reported issues, if any.
